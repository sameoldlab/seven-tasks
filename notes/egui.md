started with the eframe template at: https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template

Initial download 292 crates
Slightly worried the getting started for this had an index.thml and template.js

I'm not sure how long the "cold" build took because the app name from `./fill_template.sh` caused an error. Template includes a version for wasm. I guess it doesn't hurt to leave it in. Thankfully(!!!) it seems the html files in here are for running the wasm version. I guess it's kind of nice that they aren't thinking of that as an afterthought or "demo" platform (as long as it does not affect my native dev workflow).
