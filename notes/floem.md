Because the docs site was not loading, I tried to copy an example from the repo. This didn't run because the imports had changed and the last published version was from November 15th, 2025, almost a year ago. Floem has two large contributors. The primary developer started floem for use in Lapce, but has [not been active](https://github.com/dzhou121) on github through most of 2025.
