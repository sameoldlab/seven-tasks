## Initial Install
~410 dependencies. First build took 1m42sec for me. Comes with a couple features (fira-code, wgpu, tiny-skia) enabled.

## Learning Iced
On November 12th, 2024 the iced book is still empty. There is a YouTube video by hector using an older version of iced. but in the 0.13.1 Sandbox has been replaced with Application. I don't know what else has changed. 
This seems like a more useful resource than the official book. https://jl710.github.io/iced-guide/
